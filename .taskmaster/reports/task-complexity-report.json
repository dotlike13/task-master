			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Architecture and Infrastructure Setup",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Architecture and Infrastructure Setup' task into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Defining and provisioning the GCP networking infrastructure (VPC, subnets, firewall rules). 2. Provisioning and configuring the Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance, including initial schema and user setup. 3. Choosing between and setting up the compute environment (either GKE cluster or Cloud Run services). 4. Establishing the initial CI/CD pipeline foundation using GitHub Actions or Cloud Build for Docker image creation and deployment. 5. Configuring necessary IAM roles and service accounts for secure inter-service communication.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to its foundational nature. It involves multiple critical GCP services (GKE/Cloud Run, SQL, Networking, CI/CD) and requires significant architectural decisions that will impact the entire project's scalability and security."

			"taskTitle": "Develop Core MCP Client Module (HTTP)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Develop Core MCP Client Module (HTTP)' task into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should detail the implementation of: 1. A robust HTTP client for sending JSON-RPC requests and handling responses/errors. 2. Logic for serializing MCP tool invocation requests and deserializing responses. 3. A parser for MCP tool schemas to validate and understand available tools. 4. The main service logic for discovering tools from an MCP server and executing them based on incoming requests.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves implementing a specific external protocol (MCP over HTTP), which requires careful handling of requests, responses, and schema parsing. It's a self-contained module but critical for core functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Core A2A Server Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Develop Core A2A Server Module' task into 4 subtasks. These should cover: 1. Implementing the logic to dynamically generate A2A Agent Cards in the correct JSON format. 2. Creating the public-facing HTTP endpoint to serve the Agent Card. 3. Creating the HTTP endpoint to receive and process incoming A2A task requests. 4. Implementing input validation for incoming A2A requests to ensure they conform to the protocol specification.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. While it involves implementing a protocol (A2A), the initial scope is limited to synchronous HTTP tasks and Agent Card generation, making it a well-defined development effort within a single module."
		},

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Translation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Core Translation Engine' task into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should focus on: 1. Designing the internal data structures and strategy for mapping MCP tool schemas to A2A task schemas. 2. Implementing the forward translation logic: converting a discovered MCP tool schema into a valid A2A task schema. 3. Implementing the reverse translation logic: converting an incoming A2A task request into a valid MCP tool invocation request. 4. Creating a library of data type converters to handle differences between the two protocols. 5. Developing a comprehensive suite of unit tests with mock MCP and A2A schemas to validate the translation accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the core business logic of translating between two distinct protocols (MCP and A2A). This involves complex data mapping, schema transformation, and handling potential mismatches, which is intellectually challenging and prone to edge cases."

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Enhance A2A Server for Long-Running Tasks (SSE)' task into 4 subtasks. These should cover: 1. Designing and implementing a system for tracking the state of asynchronous tasks (e.g., in the database). 2. Creating the A2A-compliant SSE endpoint where clients can subscribe for status updates on a specific task. 3. Modifying the main task execution endpoint to immediately return a task ID and initiate the job in the background. 4. Implementing the server-side logic to push task status updates (e.g., 'running', 'completed', 'error') to the correct SSE subscribers as the task progresses.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as it requires a fundamental shift in the A2A server's architecture from a synchronous request-response model to an asynchronous, event-driven one using SSE. This involves state management for long-running jobs and handling persistent client connections."

			"taskTitle": "Enhance Dashboard with Logs and Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Enhance Dashboard with Logs and Analytics' task into 4 subtasks. These should cover: 1. Developing backend API endpoints to query and paginate structured audit logs. 2. Creating a backend process or endpoints to aggregate log data into key performance metrics (e.g., success rate, average latency). 3. Building a new 'Logging' page in the React dashboard that fetches and displays real-time or near-real-time task execution logs. 4. Building a new 'Analytics' page that uses a charting library to visualize the aggregated performance metrics.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. This task requires both backend work to aggregate and serve data from audit logs, and significant frontend work to build visualizations (charts, real-time logs). Ensuring the data aggregation is performant and the UI is responsive adds to the challenge."

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Implement Audit Logging' task into 4 subtasks. These should cover: 1. Designing a standardized, structured JSON schema for all audit log events. 2. Creating a shared logging library or module that standardizes log creation and writing to the PostgreSQL database. 3. Integrating this logging module into all relevant services to record events like API calls, task status changes, and configuration updates. 4. Adding appropriate database indexing to the audit log table to ensure efficient querying for debugging and analytics.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. While the concept is straightforward, implementing it robustly across multiple microservices is a cross-cutting concern that requires a well-designed, centralized logging schema and library to ensure consistency and avoid performance bottlenecks."
