# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Core A2A Server Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the A2A Server Module to expose A2A-compatible endpoints. This includes generating A2A Agent Cards in JSON format and handling incoming A2A task requests over HTTP.
# Details:
The server should expose endpoints for Agent Card retrieval and task execution, adhering to the A2A protocol for short-running tasks.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test Agent Card generation logic. Use an A2A client simulator to send task requests and validate the response format and correctness.
