# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Audit Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a robust audit logging system that records all significant events, including task executions, configuration changes, and access attempts, to the PostgreSQL database.
# Details:
Logs should be structured and contain sufficient detail for debugging, security audits, and compliance. This data will also feed the dashboard's analytics features.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that for every API call and task execution, a corresponding log entry is created in the database with the correct information.
