# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Core MCP Client Module (HTTP)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the MCP Client Module to connect to external MCP servers via JSON-RPC over HTTP. This module will be responsible for discovering tools and executing requests as per the MCP specification.
# Details:
The module should handle HTTP requests, parse MCP tool schemas, and manage connections. Focus on the HTTP transport protocol for the MVP.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test connection logic and schema parsing. Integration test against a reference MCP server to confirm successful tool discovery and invocation.
