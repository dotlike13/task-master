# Product Requirements Document (PRD): MCP to A2A Conversion Web Service

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a web service that enables seamless conversion of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to support the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, allowing AI agents built on MCP to interoperate with A2A-compatible agents. The service aims to bridge the gap between MCP's tool and data integration capabilities and A2A's agent-to-agent communication framework, fostering a unified AI ecosystem.

### 1.2 Background
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard developed by Anthropic for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources, enabling standardized access to resources like APIs, databases, and file systems.
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**: An open protocol by Google designed for secure, interoperable communication between AI agents, supporting task delegation and collaboration across platforms.
- **Need**: MCP focuses on agent-to-tool interactions, while A2A enables agent-to-agent communication. A conversion service is essential to allow MCP-based AI systems to participate in A2A's collaborative ecosystem, reducing integration complexity and promoting interoperability.

### 1.3 Goals
- Enable MCP servers to expose their functionalities as A2A-compatible agents.
- Provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web service for developers to convert and manage MCP-to-A2A integrations.
- Support dynamic capability discovery and task execution as per A2A protocol standards.
- Minimize setup complexity for developers integrating MCP servers with A2A ecosystems.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Description
The MCP to A2A Conversion Web Service is a cloud-based platform that transforms MCP server endpoints into A2A-compatible agent interfaces. It acts as a middleware layer, translating MCP's tool and resource interactions into A2A's task-oriented, agent-to-agent communication model. The service will provide APIs, SDKs, and a user interface for developers to configure, deploy, and monitor these conversions.

### 2.2 Key Features
1. **MCP Server Integration**:
   - Connect to existing MCP servers via supported transport protocols (e.g., HTTP, SSE, STDIO).
   - Automatically discover MCP server tools and resources (e.g., APIs, file operations, database queries).
2. **A2A Agent Card Generation**:
   - Generate A2A-compliant "Agent Cards" in JSON format to advertise MCP server capabilities to A2A clients.
   - Map MCP tools to A2A tasks, ensuring compatibility with A2A's task lifecycle management.
3. **Task Translation and Execution**:
   - Translate MCP tool invocations into A2A task objects, supporting both short-running and long-running tasks.
   - Handle A2A's request/response, SSE, and push notification models for task status updates.
4. **Authentication and Security**:
   - Support enterprise-grade authentication (e.g., OAuth2, mTLS) for secure MCP and A2A interactions.
   - Implement access controls to ensure MCP servers only expose authorized tools and data.
5. **Developer Dashboard**:
   - Provide a web-based UI for developers to configure MCP server connections, monitor A2A task execution, and view logs.
   - Offer real-time analytics on agent interactions and performance metrics.
6. **SDK and API Support**:
   - Provide Python and TypeScript SDKs for integrating the conversion service into existing workflows.
   - Expose RESTful APIs for programmatic configuration and management.
7. **Scalability and Deployment**:
   - Support deployment on cloud platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Cloudflare for high availability.
   - Enable horizontal scaling to handle multiple MCP servers and A2A agents concurrently.

### 2.3 Non-Goals
- Developing a full MCP or A2A protocol implementation from scratch.
- Supporting non-standard MCP or A2A implementations that deviate from official specifications.
- Providing hosting for MCP servers (the service assumes MCP servers are already running).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Roles
- **Developers**: Configure and manage MCP-to-A2A conversions, integrate the service into their applications, and monitor performance.
- **AI Agents**: Interact with the service as A2A clients, discovering and invoking tasks exposed by converted MCP servers.
- **Administrators**: Manage service infrastructure, security policies, and user access.

### 3.2 Use Cases
1. **Convert MCP Server to A2A Agent**:
   - Developer inputs MCP server details (e.g., endpoint URL, authentication credentials).
   - Service discovers MCP server tools and generates an A2A Agent Card.
   - A2A clients can query and invoke tasks via the service.
2. **Execute A2A Tasks**:
   - A2A client sends a task request to the service.
   - Service translates the task into an MCP tool invocation, executes it, and returns results in A2A format.
3. **Monitor and Debug**:
   - Developer uses the dashboard to view task execution logs, error messages, and performance metrics.
   - Service provides alerts for failed conversions or unauthorized access attempts.

### 3.3 User Interface
- **Dashboard**:
  - Configuration panel for adding MCP server endpoints and authentication details.
  - Real-time task execution logs and analytics (e.g., task success rate, latency).
  - Tool discovery view to map MCP tools to A2A tasks.
- **API Documentation**:
  - Interactive API explorer for RESTful endpoints.
  - SDK documentation with code samples in Python and TypeScript.

### 3.4 Integration Points
- **MCP Servers**: Connect via JSON-RPC over HTTP, SSE, or STDIO.
- **A2A Clients**: Expose A2A Agent Cards and task endpoints via HTTP and SSE.
- **Cloud Platforms**: Deploy on Google Cloud, AWS, or Cloudflare with support for serverless and containerized environments.
- **Authentication Providers**: Integrate with OAuth2, mTLS, and API key-based authentication.
